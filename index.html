                    Draco is a two year old pit and lab mixed breed. He's all white with great big
                    black spots. he's a very friendly dog and loves to play. I have known draco all
                    his life, But he has only been in my care for over a year now. I rescued draco
                    on my 23rd birthday because, His original owners couldn't care for him anymore.
                    We have been best of friend's since. <br />
